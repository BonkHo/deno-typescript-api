# deno-typescript-api

Deno is a runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript that uses V8 and is built on Rust

Deno addresses the following problems of node:

The module system (NPM)
Legacy APIs that need support
Security issues

No node_modules folder to store libraries.
Deno modules can be hosted anywhere.
Deno packages are imported with ES6 module import and from an explicit path or URL

Deno modules have no access to file or network resources unless explicitly enabled
